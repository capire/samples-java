[![REUSE status](https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/capire/samples-java)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/capire/samples-java)


## Get Started

Assumed you did your [initial setup of CAP Node.js](https://cap.cloud.sap/docs/get-started/#setup), simply copy & paste these lines to a terminal for a jumpstart:

```sh
git clone -q --recursive https://github.com/capire/samples-java
cd samples-java
npm install
npm run start
```

After download and setup this starts the bookshop server you can open a browser window and navigate to _http://localhost:8080/vue/index.html_ and login with user *alice* leaving the password field empty.
